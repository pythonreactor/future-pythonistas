For this assignment, I want you to write a class that creates an animal Object.
Use your imagination on what you want to include, but make sure to include
the following attributes:

- name
- age
- species
- color
- sound (what sound do they make)

And make sure to include the following methods:
- get_name
- get_age
- get_species
- get_color
- get_sound
- get_animal_happy (this should return a string that says "animal_name is happy")
- get_animal_sad (this should return a string that says "animal_name is sad")
